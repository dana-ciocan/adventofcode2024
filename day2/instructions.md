# What are the instructions actually telling us to do?

## Part 1

- Need to help with some "unusual" data
- This data consists of nuclear reactor reports
- Each line is one report
- Each number is a level
- Need to analyse the reports to see which ones are safe and which ones are not
- Rules for safety:
    - Levels are either all increasing or all decreasing
    - Any two adjacent levels differ by at least one and at most three
- Output how many of the reports are safe
