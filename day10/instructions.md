# Part one

The map contains hiking trails. Good hiking trails are paths that go from 0 to 9 and increment by 1 every step. Steps can only go vertical or horizontal, not diagonal.

A trailhead is any position that starts one or more hiking trails - i.e. all zeros that can potentially reach a nine.

A trialhead's "score" is how many nines it can reach.

Take the input map and find all the trailheads, calculate their scores and add them up.
