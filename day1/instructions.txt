# What are the instructions actually telling us to do?

- The list of locations is empty!
- The Chief Historian's office has a list of locations by ID rather than name
- Senior Historians are compiling lists of locations
- They don't match
- Need to pair up the numbers in the lists
- Pair smallest number in left list with smallest number in right list
- Make a note of the differences and add them up to get the answer to the puzzle

Seems simple enough?
